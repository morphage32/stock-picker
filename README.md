Stock Picker Ruby Project

This is basic ruby coding exercise where a given array of numbers will represent a stock value, one number for each day. A function will be used to calculate which day would have been the best day to buy the stock and the best day to sell (based on the highest and lowest possible values subtracted from one another). The lowest value must come before the highest value in the array in order to be valid. The results will be given with the indices of which days are best to buy and sell.
